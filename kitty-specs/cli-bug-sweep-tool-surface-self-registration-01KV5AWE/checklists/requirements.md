# Specification Quality Checklist: CLI Bug Sweep & Tool Surface Self-Registration

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-06-15
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders (primary audience: contributors/maintainers)
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Requirement types are separated (Functional / Non-Functional / Constraints)
- [x] IDs are unique across FR-###, NFR-###, and C-### entries
- [x] All requirement rows include a non-empty Status value
- [x] Non-functional requirements include measurable thresholds
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified (pathological mid8 case, built-in-only state, one-to-many definitions)
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded (Out of Scope section present)
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows (4 scenarios mapped to 4 fix areas)
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All items pass. Spec is ready for `/spec-kitty.plan`.
