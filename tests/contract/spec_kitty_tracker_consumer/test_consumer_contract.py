"""Consumer contract for spec-kitty-tracker.

Pins the subset of the tracker public surface that CLI uses. Upstream
contract changes (renaming or removing pinned symbols, or shifting their
shape) MUST break this test, per FR-005 / FR-009 / C-003 of mission
``shared-package-boundary-cutover-01KQ22DS``.

The pinned surface is documented in
``kitty-specs/shared-package-boundary-cutover-01KQ22DS/contracts/tracker_consumer_surface.md``.

The pin list was derived by grep over ``src/`` on the post-WP02 tree:

* ``from spec_kitty_tracker import FieldOwner, OwnershipMode, OwnershipPolicy, SyncEngine``
* ``from spec_kitty_tracker.models import ExternalRef``

CLI's tracker integration (``src/specify_cli/tracker/*``) is the consumer;
``specify_cli.tracker`` is the CLI-internal adapter package and MUST NOT
re-export the public PyPI surface (C-003 — enforced by the architectural
suite, not by this contract).

If future CLI work uses additional tracker symbols, update both the
contract doc and this test in the same PR.
