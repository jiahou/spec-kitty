"""Architectural guardrail (WP10 / #1355): the C-GUARD-1 import boundary.

After missions 01KTPKST + 01KTRC04 converted every commit-creating surface
onto the blessed entry point, this ratchet becomes the *permanent* C-GUARD-1
enforcement (FR-009, contracts/C-GUARD-1, NFR-004):

1.  **Single decision authority.** The protected-branch decision lives in
    exactly one place — ``core.commit_guard.evaluate`` — and is imported by
    exactly two production surfaces: the ``git.commit_helpers`` facade (which
    runs it on every commit path) and ``coordination.policy`` (which
    legitimately delegates its protected-branch verdict to the same function).
    Any third importer either re-implements the decision or smuggles it into a
    new surface — both are regressions.

2.  **No resurrected privilege channels.** WP03 DELETED the five legacy
    privilege channels that derived authorization from message text, file
    content, env, or completed-op records. They must not reappear anywhere in
    ``src/``; the asserted-at-the-surface ``GuardCapability`` replaced them.

3.  **No new two-arg compat callers.** ``safe_commit`` retains a ``destination_ref=``
    string compat shim (it builds a ``CommitTarget`` internally). Exactly one
    production call site still uses that shim — ``cli/commands/merge.py`` — a
    documented WP03-review deferral. Every other caller passes the canonical
    ``target=CommitTarget(...)``. A NEW ``destination_ref=`` caller must fail
    this ratchet so the shim cannot regrow a userbase before it is retired.

Spec source: FR-009, NFR-004, contracts/C-GUARD-1; ticket #1355; ADR
