"""WP05 / T029 — the ``status_transition.py:336`` write-target drain PROOF.

This is the OWNED home of the T029 drain decision (the WP05 ``create_intent``
test). The ``:336`` line is the ``_resolve_write_target`` FALLBACK arm
``return coord_branch or _current_branch(repo_root)`` — the last surviving git-HEAD
write-target selector, reached only when
:func:`mission_runtime.resolve_placement_only` cannot resolve the mission (the
pre-meta create window / an ad-hoc fixture whose placement is unresolvable).

T029 mandates a **negative-probe**: the "DEAD → drain" verdict is valid ONLY if an
explicit attempt to REACH ``:336`` via its genuine reaching condition
(``resolve_placement_only`` forced to raise) proves the arm is never taken even
then. A happy-path "ran create → first-write once, didn't hit it" run proves
NOTHING — ``resolve_placement_only`` succeeds for a clean coord mission and
FR-002/FR-003 mint topology AT CREATE, structurally biasing every happy-path run
toward "never hit".

**Verdict (witnessed live evidence): LEFT — the arm is REACHABLE.**

The negative-probe below forces the genuine reaching condition (a blank /
whitespace mission slug, which makes ``resolve_placement_only`` raise
``ActionContextError``) with ``coord_branch=None`` (so the ``coord_branch or …``
short-circuit cannot mask the selector), and observes that ``_current_branch`` IS
called and its value IS returned — i.e. ``:336`` is taken. Because the negative-
probe REACHES the arm, the DEFAULT verdict holds: **LEAVE the line + keep WP00's
re-keyed allow-list entry**. We do NOT drain (a speculative drain would re-open
the create-window write bug — the load-bearing-workaround trap, Risk #2) and we
do NOT re-pin a dead line (it is provably live).

If a future change genuinely retires the arm, this test is the regression that
must be revisited together with the WP00 allow-list-entry removal — they move as
a pair, gated on this negative-probe flipping to "not reached".
