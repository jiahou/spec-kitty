"""Behavioral two-ref write-surface placement guard (write-surface-coherence WP07 / T027).

The mission's headline invariant, asserted BEHAVIORALLY (not structurally) against a
REAL coordination-topology fixture, across EVERY converged write path. The bifurcation:

* PRIMARY-partition kinds (``SPEC`` / ``DATA_MODEL`` / ``RESEARCH`` / ``CHECKLIST`` /
  ``FINALIZED_EXECUTION_PLAN`` / ``TASKS_INDEX`` / ``WORK_PACKAGE_TASK`` /
  ``LANE_STATE`` / ``PRIMARY_METADATA``) resolve to the primary ``target_branch``
  for EVERY topology and NEVER transit coordination.
* COORD-partition kinds (``STATUS_STATE`` / ``ISSUE_MATRIX`` / ``ACCEPTANCE_MATRIX`` /
  ``ANALYSIS_REPORT``) keep the topology-routed coordination ref under coord topology.

Non-vacuity (research D-7 / NFR-002):

* The guard drives the **REAL resolver** (``resolve_placement_only`` /
  ``resolve_topology``) against the real coord-topology fixture — it does NOT stub
  either, unlike ``tests/coordination/test_commit_router.py`` (which stubs both and
  proves nothing about the partition). It exercises the assertion across THREE
  converged write paths: ``commit_for_mission``, the ``safe-commit`` bypass writer
  (``_resolve_commit_target``), and ``_planning_commit_worktree``.
* A MANDATORY anti-mutant negative test forces the PRE-fix partition (puts ``SPEC``
  back into ``_PLACEMENT_ARTIFACT_KINDS``) and asserts the planning-ref assertion
  goes RED — killing the "always-coord-for-coord-topology" mutant. Without it the
  two-ref guard could pass vacuously.

Fixture realism (mandatory): a real 26-char ULID ``mission_id``, real 8-char
``mid8``, a real ``<slug>-<mid8>`` mission dir, a real ``coordination_branch``, and
a NON-protected feature ``target_branch``.
