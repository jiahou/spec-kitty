"""Architectural ratchet: GuardCapability call sites in ``src/`` (PR #1850 M1).

``GuardCapability`` is asserted-at-the-surface (FR-008 / C-GUARD-2): each
non-standard member authorizes exactly ONE bookkeeping flow onto a protected
ref. PR #1850 regressed this by sprinkling ``TEST_MODE`` and
``MERGE_BOOKKEEPING`` onto ordinary task/workflow/finalize surfaces, silently
converting "refused on protected main" into "allowed". This ratchet makes the
capability/flow binding structural:

1. **No production module asserts ``TEST_MODE``.** The member exists for test
   fixtures only; the sole ``src/`` reference is the policy module's own
   ``_PROTECTED_FLOW_CAPABILITIES`` set (the enum's home).
2. **Every other protected-flow member has an explicit per-flow allowlist.**
   ``MERGE_BOOKKEEPING`` belongs to the merge done-transitions flow,
   ``UPGRADE_BOOKKEEPING`` to the upgrade flow, ``RELEASE_FLOW`` currently has
   no caller (S6 wire-or-delete debt — adding one requires updating this
   allowlist deliberately).

The scan is AST-based (real ``GuardCapability.<MEMBER>`` attribute
expressions), so prose mentions in docstrings/comments do not trip it.
