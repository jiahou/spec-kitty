"""Conftest for dashboard tests.

WP03 routes ``resolve_project_charter_path`` (and through it the dashboard
scanner) through the FR-004 chokepoint. The chokepoint requires a git repo
to resolve the canonical root; pre-WP03 dashboard tests created
``tmp_path`` fixtures without ``git init``. We initialize an empty repo
whenever a dashboard test asks for ``tmp_path`` to honor the new contract
without rewriting every test fixture body, and clear the resolver LRU
between tests.
