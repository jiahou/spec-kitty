# Doctrine

The **doctrine** package is a standalone catalog of reusable governance
knowledge. It ships typed, schema-validated YAML artifacts that define *how work
should be done* — independent of any specific project or charter configuration.

## What it contains

| Artifact kind | Directory | What it defines |
|---|---|---|
| **Paradigm** | `paradigms/` | Worldview-level framing (e.g. test-first, DDD) |
| **Directive** | `directives/` | Constraint-oriented governance rules |
| **Tactic** | `tactics/` | Reusable step-by-step behavioral recipes |
| **Procedure** | `procedures/` | Stateful multi-step workflows with entry/exit conditions |
| **Styleguide** | `styleguides/` | Cross-cutting quality and consistency conventions |
| **Toolguide** | `toolguides/` | Tool-specific operational syntax and guidance |
| **Schema** | `schemas/` | Machine-validated contracts for artifact structure |
| **Template** | `templates/` | Output scaffolds and interaction contracts |
| **Agent Profile** | `agent_profiles/` | Declarative agent identity and collaboration contracts |
| **Mission** | `missions/` | Workflow definitions (state machines, action indices, templates) |

## Design principle

Doctrine is a **pure knowledge library**. It has no dependency on the charter
package or the CLI. The charter package reads from doctrine to compile
project-specific governance bundles, but doctrine itself is unaware of any
consumer.

**Dependency direction:** nothing in this package imports from `charter` or
`specify_cli`.

## Authoring pipeline

New artifacts are authored directly in each kind's `shipped/` tree (for
example `directives/shipped/NNN-name.directive.yaml`). Cross-artifact
relationships are expressed as edges in `graph.yaml`, not as inline
reference fields inside each YAML. Raw reference material may still be
captured under `_reference/` as an intake landing zone; converting it to
doctrine is a manual editorial step that writes the shipped YAML plus the
matching `graph.yaml` edges.
