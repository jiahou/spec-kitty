"""Spec-kitty side glue for ``spec-kitty-tracker.bidirectional_sync()`` (FR-031).

This module owns the bounded-retry policy that wraps tracker bidirectional
sync calls: exponential backoff capped at a per-attempt ceiling, plus a
total wall-clock cap, plus a structured failure type that carries the
retry history. It exists so:

* the spec-kitty side has exactly one place that knows the policy
  (paired with the contract in
  ``kitty-specs/stability-and-hygiene-hardening-2026-04-01KQ4ARB/contracts/tracker-public-imports.md``);
* tests can drive the retry loop deterministically with a mock callable;
* the user-facing failure line is gated by the dedup helper from
  ``specify_cli.auth.transport`` (FR-029 pairing).

The glue is intentionally generic: it accepts any zero-arg callable as
the ``sync_call`` and translates exceptions into retries until the cap
is hit. This keeps the module decoupled from the upstream
``spec_kitty_tracker`` import surface (which lives behind a dependency
boundary documented in
``contracts/tracker-public-imports.md``).

Target authority (WP02, contract §1): this module is **target-agnostic** —
it derives no server URL and constructs no tracker client, so there is no
independent target to redirect here. The tracker network target is the one
canonical ``ResolvedSyncTarget.resolved_server_url`` (the same URL sync,
WebSocket, the queue scope and batch posts use); it is bound where the tracker
client is constructed (``SaaSTrackerClient``), and the caller passes the
already-targeted ``sync_call`` into :func:`run_bidirectional_sync_with_retry`.
This wrapper only owns the bounded-retry policy around that call, so it can
never bind the tracker to a different target than sync.
