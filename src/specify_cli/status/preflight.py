"""Preflight helpers for transition gates.

This module provides ownership-policy helpers used by the dirty-state
preflight that backs ``agent tasks move-task`` and related transitions.

Ownership policy for ``snapshot-latest.json`` (per mission
``charter-e2e-827-followups-01KQAJA0`` and contract
``contracts/dossier-snapshot-ownership.md``): **EXCLUDE**.

The dossier snapshot at
``<feature_dir>/.kittify/dossiers/<mission_slug>/snapshot-latest.json`` is a
mutable, derived, ephemeral artifact that is recomputable from the dossier
source. It is excluded from version control via ``.gitignore`` (the common
case) AND filtered from any code path that computes dirty state in a way that
bypasses ``.gitignore`` (belt-and-suspenders, per research R6).

Per Constraint **C-006** in the spec, this module implements **exactly one**
ownership policy (EXCLUDE) — no conditional dual-policy runtime branch.
