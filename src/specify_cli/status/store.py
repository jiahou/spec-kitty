"""JSONL event store for status events.

Provides append-only persistence of StatusEvent records to a JSONL file
(status.events.jsonl). Each line is a JSON object with deterministic
(sorted) key ordering.

Back-compat reader (T024, FR-023):
    Events written before WP05 carry only ``mission_slug`` for mission
    identity. Events written after WP05 carry both ``mission_slug`` AND
    ``mission_id`` (a ULID from meta.json).

    The :func:`read_events` reader tolerates both shapes and resolves the
    ``mission_id`` for legacy events by reading the corresponding
    ``meta.json`` file. The slug→mission_id mapping is cached per call
    inside ``_SlugResolver`` to avoid repeated disk reads.
