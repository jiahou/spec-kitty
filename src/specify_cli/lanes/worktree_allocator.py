"""Lane worktree allocation.

Allocates or reuses worktrees for execution lanes. Each lane gets
exactly one worktree and one branch. Sequential WPs in the same
lane share the worktree — no recreation between WPs.

The mission integration branch is created (if absent) when the
first lane worktree is allocated.

#1348 (WP04): when the mission carries a ``coordination_branch`` field
in ``meta.json`` (new-topology missions, WP03+), the lane branch is
parented on the coordination branch rather than the legacy
``mission_branch`` field, and the lane worktree gets a sparse-checkout
policy registered so it cannot see ``status.events.jsonl`` or
``status.json`` (FR-024 / FR-025 / FR-029).

    Issue #1684 — cross-lane dependency propagation: a lane may declare

    sibling-lane code it builds on. Both the FRESH-creation path and the

    already-merged tips fast-forward to a no-op — so re-entering a lane after a
    dependency was approved late (the WP05/WP09 double-hit on 01KTYGTE) picks up
    the newly-approved tip. A dependency lane whose branch no longer resolves
    (merged-and-deleted post-mission) is skipped with a warning; a true merge

      auto-resolve is aborted (``git merge --abort``) and the lane is then reset
      hard to the ref recorded BEFORE the loop, so no *earlier* clean dep merge
      survives a *later* dep conflict. Without this, ``git merge --abort`` only
      undoes the conflicting merge, orphaning a partially-propagated state the
