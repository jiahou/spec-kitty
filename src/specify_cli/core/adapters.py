"""Pending-origin consumer registry for core mission creation.

Provides a result-bearing callable registry so that
``core/mission_creation.py`` can invoke the tracker's pending-origin
consumer without importing the INTEGRATION set (``tracker.*``,
``sync.*``, ``saas.*``).

The registry uses the same idiom as ``status/adapters.py``:

* Idempotent by qualified name — re-registering a handler with the
  same ``__module__.__qualname__`` replaces the existing entry.
* Non-raising — exceptions from the registered consumer are caught;
  the error message is returned in the third tuple element.
* No INTEGRATION imports in this module.
* No third-party imports.

# *cold-miss* (a staged binding present on disk while no consumer is registered)
# without importing the INTEGRATION ``tracker`` package. If tracker ever moves
# the file, this constant and that one must stay in lockstep; the tracker-side
# test suite guards the producer path.

    This is a *cold-miss*: a ``.kittify/pending-origin.yaml`` file is present on

    before any consumer registered itself with the registry — typically because
    a caller invoked ``create_mission_core`` without first importing
    ``specify_cli.tracker`` (whose startup hook performs registration).

    Silently returning the no-pending-origin default in this case would *drop*
    the staged binding without trace. We fail loud instead (fail-closed-loud),
