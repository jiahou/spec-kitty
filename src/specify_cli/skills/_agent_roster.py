"""Single-source authority for the skill-only agent roster (#1941).

Historically the tuple of command-skill agents (``codex``, ``vibe``, ``pi``,
``letta``) was duplicated as three byte-identical literals:

* ``skills/command_installer.py``  ``SUPPORTED_AGENTS``
* ``skills/command_renderer.py``   ``SUPPORTED_AGENTS``
* ``cli/commands/agent/config.py`` ``SKILL_ONLY_AGENTS``

That triplicate literal is a textbook **connascence of value** smell: the three
copies are equal *only by convention*, with nothing forcing them to stay in
sync. This module collapses them onto one authority.

It is a deliberately **dependency-free leaf**: it imports nothing from
``specify_cli.skills`` (or anywhere else in the package), so every other module
can import *from* it without risking an import cycle. In particular
``command_installer`` already imports ``command_renderer`` at module load, so
the authority must live below both of them — here.
