"""Mission-aware planning-commit router (FR-001/002/005).

Extracted from ``cli/commands/agent/mission.py`` to provide a single canonical
``commit_for_mission`` entry point that:

1. Resolves the placement via ``mission_runtime.resolve_placement_only``.
2. If the resolved placement is COORDINATION and the policy marks the target ref
   as protected, materialises the coordination worktree on demand and stages the
   artifacts there before committing.
3. Otherwise commits directly to the primary checkout (flattened / unprotected).

This module owns the extraction described in WP02 / IC-02. The three formerly
open-coded inline commit tails in ``mission.py`` (gap-analysis, generator-config,
finalize-tasks) are folded into this entry point (T027 / #2056).

Design basis: ``plan.md`` (IC-02), ADR ``2026-06-21-1``.

C-001 (no parallel materialiser): every coordination worktree materialisation
goes through the single canonical ``CoordinationWorkspace.resolve()`` path.
NFR-001 (#1718 create-window): materialisation happens at the COMMIT boundary,
not at read time.
