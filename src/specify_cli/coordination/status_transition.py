    FR-009 / SC-001: the read-contract coord-vs-primary SHAPE is decided by the
    WP02 topology SSOT, never re-inferred from a bare ``coordination_branch is
    None`` SURFACE test — the exact forbidden re-derivation SC-001 gates against.

    This answers ONLY "is this a coord-SHAPED mission?". The transient on-disk
    arms in the caller (worktree-exists / branch-deleted) keep PROBING the
    materialized-yet/deleted-now state (C-006: #1718 create-window / #1848
    coord-deleted) — the stored topology must NOT answer that transient question.

    Mirrors the canonical WP03 surface-resolver pattern
    (``surface_resolver._topology_uses_coord_surface``): the binary
    coord-vs-primary SHAPE is disposed by the WP02 topology SSOT
    (:func:`mission_runtime.classify_topology`) over the stored
    ``coordination_branch`` VALUE, NOT by a bare ``coordination_branch is None``
    re-inference. ``has_lanes`` is irrelevant to the binary coord-routing SHAPE
    (both ``COORD`` and ``LANES_WITH_COORD`` route through coordination), so the
    coord-less default arm is used — identical to the surface resolver's
    historical two-arg call sites.

    The shape is READ from the WP02 stored ``topology`` (the relocated read site
    now READS the stored value rather than relaying a parallel
    ``classify_topology(coord_branch, …)`` inference — randy #2 / SC-001): the
    PURE :func:`read_topology` reader is anchored on the canonical primary
    ``feature_dir`` the identity carries (where ``meta.json`` lives). An
    un-backfilled legacy mission (or absent/malformed meta) degrades to deriving
    the shape ONCE from the ``coordination_branch`` value via WP01's
    :func:`classify_topology` SSOT — the same single authority, no parallel grid.

    The derivation is **pure** (no ``meta.json`` write), so a status READ never
    persists a ``topology`` back-fill (the read-must-not-write contract, #1814).
    ``mid8`` materialization / branch-deletion stay the transient probe arms below
    (C-006).
