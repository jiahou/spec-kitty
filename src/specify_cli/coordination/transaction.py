"""BookkeepingTransaction — atomic emit + commit on the coordination branch.

This module implements the contract in
``contracts/bookkeeping_transaction.md``.

It is the single owner of writes that target the coordination branch:

    acquire → policy gate → append → materialize → commit → outbound → release

On exception, performs **surgical truncate** rollback of the event log
(FR-010) and byte-snapshot rollback of any other artifact written via
:meth:`BookkeepingTransaction.write_artifact`. It NEVER uses
``git checkout --`` (C-009 prohibits it for any rollback path).

Spec source: FR-019, FR-020, FR-021, FR-023, FR-026, FR-033, C-009,
C-013, NFR-001, NFR-008, NFR-010.
