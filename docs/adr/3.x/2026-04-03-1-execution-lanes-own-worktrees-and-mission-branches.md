## Context and Problem Statement

Spec Kitty currently treats `WorkPackage` as both the planning/review unit and the
git/worktree execution unit. That coupling is wrong.

`WorkPackage` is a planning artifact. It is useful for decomposition, review
accounting, and acceptance scoping. A `worktree` is an execution-isolation
mechanism. It is useful for preventing overlapping edits from colliding, keeping
context warm for a coherent slice of work, and making integration predictable.

Feature `028-saas-active-projects-shell` exposed the failure mode clearly:

1. A correct landing-page implementation landed.
2. Later work in another parallel execution branch touched overlapping dashboard files.
3. A stale merge reintroduced old code.
4. The feature was declared complete before the integrated mission branch
   actually satisfied the spec.

The problem was not "too much parallelism". The problem was "parallel branches
were created on the wrong boundary". We need git isolation based on conflict and
integration surfaces, not on planning-document boundaries.

## Decision Drivers

* **Safe parallelism** — parallel work should be enabled only where write scopes
  are materially disjoint.
* **Deterministic integration** — the product should be validated on one
  integrated mission branch before merging to `main`.
* **Reduced stale-merge regressions** — branches that overlap on the same
  surfaces must not drift independently for long periods.
* **Warm execution context** — sequential work on the same surface should reuse
  the same branch/worktree.
* **Planner/runtime coherence** — planning artifacts should express both
  dependency order and merge-risk boundaries.

## Considered Options

* **Option 1:** Continue with one worktree per work package
* **Option 2:** One worktree per execution lane, with a mission integration branch
* **Option 3:** One worktree per mission, even when work is safely parallelisable

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option: Option 2**, because it preserves useful parallelism while
moving git isolation to the correct unit: the execution lane.

### Core Decision

1. `WorkPackage` remains the planning, review, and accounting unit.
2. `ExecutionLane` becomes the git branch and worktree unit.
3. Every active lane gets one long-lived branch and one worktree.
4. Multiple sequential WPs may execute inside the same lane branch/worktree.
5. Every mission gets one integration branch.
6. Only the mission integration branch may merge to `main`.

### Lane Computation Contract

The planner MUST emit a machine-readable `lanes.json` artifact after tasks are
finalized.

Lane computation MUST consider both:

1. the WP dependency DAG, and
2. predicted write-scope / product-surface overlap.

Two WPs MUST be placed in the same lane when any of the following are true:

1. one depends on the other,
2. they share predicted file paths,
3. they share predicted product surfaces,
4. one is a cleanup/deprecation WP for a surface changed by the other,
5. one is an integration/QA WP validating the other in integrated form.

The lane manifest is mandatory runtime input. `implement`, `review`, `accept`,
and `merge` MUST fail closed when `lanes.json` is absent or malformed. There is
no runtime fallback to per-WP worktrees, per-WP branches, or structure
"detection" logic.

### Branch Model

1. Mission integration branch naming MUST follow:
   `kitty/mission-<feature-slug>`
2. Lane branch naming MUST follow:
   `kitty/mission-<feature-slug>-lane-<id>`
3. Lane branches merge into the mission integration branch continuously at
   stable checkpoints.
4. `main` is updated only from the mission integration branch, never directly
   from a lane branch.
5. When the planner computes exactly one lane, the feature gets exactly one
   worktree and one lane branch. Sequential DAGs are valid single-lane
   features, not a reason to recreate per-WP worktrees.

### Stale-Lane Merge Guard

A lane branch MUST NOT merge into the mission integration branch when:

1. the mission branch has advanced since the lane last synced, and
2. the changed-file intersection between lane and mission branch is non-empty.

In that case, the lane MUST first rebase or merge mission-branch changes, then
re-run review on the overlapping diff before merging.

## Consequences

### Positive

* Parallelism is preserved where it is actually safe.
* Sequential work on one surface stops paying the overhead of creating new
  branches/worktrees for every WP.
* Mission integration becomes explicit instead of being an accidental side
  effect of a final merge.
* Stale branch merges that reintroduce reverted code become blockable by policy,
  not just discoverable after damage.

### Negative

* Planner complexity increases because lane computation now needs conflict
  heuristics, not just dependency ordering.
* Lane branches are longer-lived than transient task branches and therefore
  need better merge discipline.
* Progress accounting becomes two-dimensional: WPs are still tracked, but lane
  state must also be visible.

### Neutral

* Existing WP review checkpoints remain valid; they now happen inside a lane
  rather than implying one branch per WP.
* Cleanup WPs are no longer presumed independent. They inherit the lane of the
  surface they clean unless proven otherwise.

### Confirmation

This decision is validated when all of the following are true:

1. Planner output includes `lanes.json` for each mission.
2. Missions with no safe parallelism produce exactly one lane and one worktree.
3. Missions with safe disjoint work produce multiple lanes without overlapping
   write scopes.
4. QA and final acceptance happen on the mission integration branch, not on a
   stale lane branch.
5. Regressions of the Feature 028 class are blocked by stale-lane merge guards
   before they reach `main`.
6. No shipped runtime command creates or merges `.worktrees/<feature>-WP##`
   worktrees or `<feature>-WP##` branches.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Option 1: One worktree per work package

Each WP gets its own branch and worktree regardless of write overlap.

**Pros:**

* Simple mental model on paper.
* Easy to explain if planning and execution boundaries are treated as identical.

**Cons:**

* Wrong isolation boundary — overlapping surfaces still diverge independently.
* Sequential WPs on the same surface pay repeated worktree and merge overhead.
* Encourages QA to review non-integrated branch states.
* Caused the stale-merge regression class seen in Feature 028.

### Option 2: One worktree per execution lane

Use conflict-aware lanes as the execution unit and keep WPs as planning units.

**Pros:**

* Aligns branch isolation with actual merge risk.
* Preserves context for sequential work on one surface.
* Makes integrated mission-branch QA the natural default.

**Cons:**

* Requires new planner output and new scheduling/orchestration logic.
* Lane boundaries must be explained and visualized clearly.

### Option 3: One worktree per mission

All work for a mission happens in one branch/worktree, even if disjoint.

**Pros:**

* Simplest branch topology.
* No cross-lane merge risk inside a mission.

**Cons:**

* Sacrifices legitimate parallelism.
* Creates needless serial bottlenecks on disjoint surfaces.
* Makes large missions slower and noisier than necessary.
