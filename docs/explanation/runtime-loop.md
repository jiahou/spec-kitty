# The Runtime Loop Explained

Spec Kitty offers two ways to advance work through a mission: slash commands and the runtime loop. This document explains the runtime loop -- what it is, when to use it, and how to interpret what it tells you.

**Terminology note**
- Canonical 2.x model: `Mission Type -> Mission -> Mission Run`
- `spec-kitty next` uses `--mission` as the canonical tracked-mission selector

## What Is `spec-kitty next`?

In a typical workflow, a human decides what to do next. They look at the kanban board, pick a work package, and run the appropriate slash command (`/spec-kitty.implement`, `/spec-kitty.review`, and so on). The human is the decision-maker.

`spec-kitty next` inverts that relationship. Instead of the human choosing the next action, the **runtime decides** and tells the agent what to do. The agent calls `spec-kitty next`, receives a decision, executes it, reports the result, and asks again. This is the runtime loop.

```
Agent asks: "What should I do next?"
    |
    v
Runtime evaluates mission state, WP status, guards, priorities
    |
    v
Runtime returns a decision: "Implement WP03 -- here is the prompt file"
    |
    v
Agent executes the work, reports the result
    |
    v
Agent asks again: "What should I do next?"
```

The runtime considers several factors when making its decision:

- **Mission phase** -- Which step in the mission workflow is active (specify, plan, tasks, implement, review, accept)
- **Work package status** -- Which WPs are planned, in progress, done, or blocked
- **Guard conditions** -- Whether required artifacts exist, whether prerequisites are met
- **Priority ordering** -- Reviews before new implementations, dependency-free WPs before dependent ones

## When to Use the Runtime Loop

**Use `spec-kitty next` when:**

- You are running multi-agent orchestration (multiple agents working on the same mission in parallel)
- You want autonomous mission execution where agents run in a loop without human intervention
- You want the runtime to determine ordering and priority rather than choosing manually

**Use slash commands directly when:**

- You are working manually on a single mission
- You are a single developer working through one work package at a time
- You want explicit control over which action to take next

The two approaches are complementary. Slash commands give you direct control. The runtime loop gives you automation.

## Query Mode vs Advancing Mode

`spec-kitty next` has two distinct modes:

- **Query mode** is the read-only form: `spec-kitty next --mission <slug> --json`
- **Advancing mode** is the runtime loop form: `spec-kitty next --agent <name> --mission <slug> ...`

Use query mode when you want to inspect the current run state without changing it. On a fresh run, the canonical query JSON returns `mission_state: "not_started"` and a non-null `preview_step` telling you which step would be issued first. `unknown` is a legacy transitional value and is no longer the primary contract to teach or consume.

Use advancing mode when an agent is actively executing the loop. In this mode, `--result` reports the outcome of the previous issued step and the runtime may advance mission state.

Planning-artifact work packages follow the same runtime loop, but they execute in repository root outside the lane graph. Their workspace is the main checkout rather than a lane worktree.

## The Four Advancing Decisions

In advancing mode, every call to `spec-kitty next` returns exactly one of four decision kinds. Each tells the agent something different about what to do.

### `step` -- An action is available

The runtime has identified work to do. The decision includes an `action` (such as "implement" or "review"), a `wp_id` (which work package), and a `prompt_file` containing the full instructions.

**What to do:** Read the prompt file and execute the work described in it.

**Example output:**

```json
{
  "kind": "step",
  "agent": "claude",
  "mission_slug": "042-test-feature",
  "mission": "software-dev",
  "action": "implement",
  "wp_id": "WP02",
  "workspace_path": ".worktrees/042-test-feature-lane-b",
  "prompt_file": "/tmp/spec-kitty-next-claude-042-test-feature-implement-WP02.md",
  "reason": null,
  "guard_failures": [],
  "progress": {
    "total_wps": 5,
    "done_wps": 1,
    "in_progress_wps": 1,
    "planned_wps": 3,
    "for_review_wps": 0
  },
  "step_id": "implement"
}
```

### `decision_required` -- The runtime needs input

The runtime has reached a point where it cannot proceed without a choice. It provides a question, a set of options, and a `decision_id` that you use to send back your answer.

**What to do:** Read the question and options. Answer with:

```bash
spec-kitty next --agent <agent> --mission <slug> \
  --answer "<your choice>" --decision-id "<decision_id>" --json
```

If the agent cannot determine the answer, escalate to the user.

### `blocked` -- Cannot proceed

Something is preventing the mission from advancing. The `reason` field explains the high-level problem, and `guard_failures` lists the specific conditions that are not met.

**What to do:** Read the reason and guard failures. Common blockers include:

| Blocker | Typical Resolution |
|---|---|
| Missing artifacts (spec.md, plan.md) | Run the planning workflow first |
| Upstream WP not done | Implement or review the upstream WP |
| Review feedback not addressed | Re-implement, address feedback, move back to for_review |
| Stale agent (WP stuck in doing) | Move WP to planned with `--force`, then re-dispatch |
| Circular dependencies | Edit WP frontmatter to break the cycle, re-run finalize-tasks |

### `terminal` -- Mission complete

All work is done. There are no more steps to execute.

**What to do:** Run `/spec-kitty.accept` for final validation. If it passes,
run `/spec-kitty.merge`, then run `/spec-kitty-mission-review` and the
retrospective workflow.

## The Agent Loop Pattern

At a conceptual level, an agent running the runtime loop follows this pattern:

1. Call `spec-kitty next --agent <name> --mission <slug> --json`
2. Read the decision kind
3. If **step**: read the prompt file, do the work, report the result
4. If **decision_required**: answer the question (or escalate to the user)
5. If **blocked**: diagnose the blocker, attempt to resolve it
6. If **terminal**: run acceptance and exit
7. Report the result of the previous step with `--result success` (or `failed` or `blocked`)
8. Go back to step 1

The loop continues until the runtime returns `terminal` or the agent hits a blocker it cannot resolve.

### WP iteration within a single step

During the implementation phase, multiple calls to `spec-kitty next` will return different `wp_id` values but the **same `step_id`** ("implement"). The runtime stays on the "implement" step while cycling through work packages. It only advances to the next mission step (such as "review") when all WPs have reached a terminal or handoff lane (`done`, `approved`, or `for_review`).

This means that in a mission with WP01 through WP09, successive calls might return:

- `step_id: "implement"`, `wp_id: "WP01"`
- `step_id: "implement"`, `wp_id: "WP02"`
- `step_id: "implement"`, `wp_id: "WP03"`
- ...and so on until all WPs are accepted-ready

The same behavior applies to the review step.

### Reporting results

After completing a step, tell the runtime what happened:

```bash
# After successful work
spec-kitty next --agent <name> --mission <slug> --result success --json

# After a failure
spec-kitty next --agent <name> --mission <slug> --result failed --json

# After hitting a blocker
spec-kitty next --agent <name> --mission <slug> --result blocked --json
```

If `--result` is omitted, the command stays in read-only query mode. Query mode may still accept `--agent` as a compatibility form, but it does not advance mission state.

## Things to Be Aware Of

### Completed missions may not return `terminal` (#335)

When `spec-kitty next` is called on a mission where all WPs are done but no prior runtime state exists, the runtime may create a new run starting from the beginning of the mission instead of recognizing that the mission is already complete. It will return `kind: "step"` even though there is nothing left to do.

**Workaround:** Always check the `progress` field in the response. If
approved/done WPs account for `progress.total_wps`, treat the mission as ready
for acceptance regardless of the reported `kind`. Run `/spec-kitty.accept`;
if it passes, merge and continue to mission-review plus retrospective.

### Some steps may return a null prompt file (#336)

Certain mission steps (such as `discovery`) do not have command templates. When the runtime reaches one of these steps, it returns a `step` decision with `prompt_file: null`. An agent that tries to read a null prompt file will fail.

**Workaround:** Always check that `prompt_file` is not null before attempting to read it. If it is null, treat the decision as blocked -- do not attempt to execute without a prompt.
