# Spec Kitty 3.2 current overview

You are looking at Spec Kitty 3.2 documentation. This is the current product surface for new projects and upgrades.

## Answer summary

- Current target version: Spec Kitty 3.2.
- Current runtime model: Charter-era missions with governed context injection.
- Current governance source: `.kittify/charter/charter.md`.
- Current mission loop: `spec-kitty next --agent <name> --mission <slug>`.
- Upgrade path: [Migration to Spec Kitty 3.2](../migration/index.md).

## What is Charter?

Charter is the governance layer introduced in Spec Kitty 3.x. A single human-edited file
(`charter.md`) drives a synthesis pipeline that produces structured context for governed mission
actions and standalone profile invocations. The flow is:

```
charter.md  ->  charter synthesize  ->  validated Charter state  ->  governed prompt/context
```

When you run `spec-kitty next --agent <name> --mission <slug>`, the runtime automatically injects
the relevant Charter context into the prompt file it returns for the next mission action. Separate
profile-invocation commands such as `ask`, `advise`, and `do` use the same governed-context model
for standalone work.

For the full mental model, see [How Charter Works](charter-overview.md).

## Migration

Upgrading from an earlier version? See:

- [Migrating from 2.x / Early 3.x](../migration/from-charter-2x.md) — What changed, migration steps, and known failure modes

---

## What is archived

Documentation for Spec Kitty 1.x and 2.x is preserved through the [migration hub](../migration/index.md) for historical context. The 2.x governance model did not include the DRG-backed synthesis pipeline or the retrospective learning loop. If you are running a current project, use the 3.2 documentation above.
