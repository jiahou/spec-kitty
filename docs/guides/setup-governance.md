# How to Set Up Project Governance

Spec Kitty uses a charter to govern how agents behave during workflow actions. This guide walks you through creating a charter, generating structured config from it, and keeping everything in sync as your project evolves.

## Prerequisites

- Spec Kitty 3.x installed — verify with `uv run spec-kitty --version`
- A project initialized with `uv run spec-kitty init` inside a git working tree

## Understanding the 3-Layer Model

Governance is built on three layers. Only the first layer is human-edited; the other two are derived automatically.

### Layer 1: Charter (`charter.md`)

The Spec Kitty runtime policy document. It lives at `.kittify/charter/charter.md` and is written
in markdown. You create it through the interview process or write it by hand. This is the only
Spec Kitty governance file you should ever edit directly.

If your repository already has a public constitution or governance document outside `.kittify/`,
keep that document in place and make `charter.md` the concise runtime charter: summarize the
binding directives agents need, name the external public authority, and point agents at its
directory through `authority_paths` when useful. Do not duplicate the full public document unless
your project deliberately wants a committed mirror.

### Layer 2: Extracted Config (YAML files)

Machine-readable config derived deterministically from your charter. These files are overwritten every time you run sync or generate:

- `governance.yaml` -- Testing standards, quality gates, performance targets, branching rules, and doctrine selections
- `directives.yaml` -- Numbered project rules with severity levels and action scopes
- `metadata.yaml` -- Hash of the charter, timestamp of last sync

### Layer 3: Doctrine References and Project Doctrine

`references.yaml` records the built-in and local doctrine references selected by the charter.
`charter synthesize` can then promote project-local doctrine artifacts into `.kittify/doctrine/`.
Current `charter generate` does not copy doctrine pages into an authoritative `library/*.md`
tree; runtime context resolves doctrine through the reference manifest and doctrine service.

Supporting public governance documents are declared in the charter as repository-relative paths:

```yaml
governance_references:
  - spec/constitution.md
```

These references are required reading in `charter context` output. `charter status` warns if a
declared file is missing, absolute, or resolves outside the repository root.

### How the Layers Connect

```
charter.md    (you edit this)
       |
   [sync / generate]
       |
       +-- governance.yaml     (auto-generated)
       +-- directives.yaml     (auto-generated)
       +-- metadata.yaml       (auto-generated)
       +-- references.yaml     (auto-generated)
       +-- synthesis state     (after synthesize)
```

When you run a governed workflow action through `spec-kitty next`, the runtime reads the
extracted config and doctrine references, then renders relevant governance context into the
prompt file returned to the agent.

---

## Step 1: Run the Interview

The interview captures your project's policy decisions and saves them as structured answers.

### Quick Path (Non-Interactive)

Use `--defaults` to accept deterministic defaults without prompts. Good for bootstrapping or CI:

```bash
spec-kitty charter interview \
  --profile minimal \
  --defaults \
  --json
```

### Full Interactive Path

For a thorough setup, use the comprehensive profile which asks 11 questions:

```bash
spec-kitty charter interview \
  --profile comprehensive
```

### What the Interview Asks

**Minimal profile (8 questions):**

| Question | What it controls |
|----------|-----------------|
| Project intent | Policy summary in the charter preamble |
| Languages and frameworks | Styleguide selection (e.g., Python) |
| Testing requirements | Test framework, minimum coverage |
| Quality gates | Linting, type checking, pre-commit hooks |
| Review policy | Required PR approvals, branch strategy |
| Performance targets | CLI timeout thresholds |
| Deployment constraints | Branch naming and protection rules |

**Comprehensive profile adds 4 more:**

| Question | What it controls |
|----------|-----------------|
| Documentation policy | Added as a project directive |
| Risk boundaries | Added as a project directive |
| Amendment process | How the charter itself can be changed |
| Exception policy | How to handle one-off policy exceptions |

### Override Selections

You can override doctrine selections on the command line:

```bash
spec-kitty charter interview \
  --profile minimal \
  --defaults \
  --selected-paradigms "test-first" \
  --selected-directives "TEST_FIRST" \
  --available-tools "spec-kitty,git,python,pytest,ruff,mypy,uv" \
  --json
```

The interview saves its answers to `.kittify/charter/interview/answers.yaml`.

---

## Step 2: Generate the Charter

Generate the charter markdown and all derived files from your interview answers:

```bash
spec-kitty charter generate --from-interview --json
```

This does two things in sequence:

1. Renders `charter.md` from your answers and doctrine templates
2. Automatically runs sync to extract structured YAML

After generation, your `.kittify/charter/` directory contains the full governance bundle.

> **Note (3.2.0a6+):** `charter generate` auto-tracks the produced
> `charter.md` (it stages the file via `git add` and ensures the required
> `.gitignore` entries exist for the derived artifacts). You do **not**
> need to run `git add charter.md` before `spec-kitty charter bundle
> validate` — the bundle is accepted immediately. If `generate` is run
> outside a git working tree it fails fast with an actionable error
> naming `git init` as the remediation.

### Overwrite an Existing Charter

If you already have a charter and want to regenerate from scratch:

```bash
spec-kitty charter generate --from-interview --force --json
```

### Choose a Template Set

Override the doctrine template set if your project needs a different workflow shape:

```bash
spec-kitty charter generate \
  --from-interview \
  --template-set plan-default \
  --json
```

Available template sets: `software-dev-default`, `plan-default`, `documentation-default`, `research-default`.

### Existing Public Constitution

For projects with a document such as `spec/constitution.md`, prefer a runtime charter that
references it rather than copying it wholesale:

````markdown
## External Governance Authority

The public project constitution lives in `spec/constitution.md`. This runtime charter summarizes
the directives Spec Kitty injects into mission prompts.

```yaml
authority_paths:
  - spec/
```
````

Then run:

```bash
spec-kitty charter sync --json
spec-kitty charter status --json
```

`authority_paths` entries are directories. Use the containing directory for a single public
constitution file.

---

## Step 3: Check Status

After generation (or at any time), check whether your governance config is current:

```bash
spec-kitty charter status --json
```

This reports:

- **synced** -- The extracted config matches the current charter
- **stale** -- The charter has been edited since the last sync

When status shows "stale", agents may be working with outdated policy. Run sync to fix it.
Status also reports missing supporting governance references declared by `governance_references`.

---

## Step 4: Sync After Manual Edits

When you edit `charter.md` by hand, sync the changes to extracted config:

```bash
spec-kitty charter sync --json
```

Sync is idempotent. If the charter hash has not changed since the last sync, extraction is skipped. To force re-extraction regardless:

```bash
spec-kitty charter sync --force --json
```

Sync reads only `.kittify/charter/charter.md`. If that file is a generated copy, regenerate the
copy from your external constitution before running sync. If it is a symlink, sync follows the
symlink for reads but still writes generated YAML into `.kittify/charter/`. `charter generate`
refuses to overwrite a symlinked `charter.md` before compilation or generated-file writes; update
the symlink target directly or replace the symlink with a regular runtime charter before
regenerating. For Windows or mixed-platform teams, prefer a runtime summary or generated copy unless
native Windows CI has already proven symlink support for the checkout.

---

## Step 5: Understand Context Loading

During governed workflow actions, the runtime automatically loads governance context into agent
prompts. You do not need to call this manually during normal use.

### How It Works

When `spec-kitty next` builds a prompt for a mission action, the runtime uses the same context
builder exposed for debugging as:

```bash
spec-kitty charter context --action <action> --json
```

This returns governance text tailored to the current action.

### Context Modes

| Mode | When it fires | What the agent sees |
|------|--------------|---------------------|
| Bootstrap | First time an action loads context | Full policy summary (up to 8 bullets) plus a list of reference docs |
| Compact | Subsequent loads for the same action | Resolved paradigms, directives, tools, and template set only |
| Missing | No charter exists | Instructions telling the agent to create one |

First-load state is tracked per action in `.kittify/charter/context-state.json`. Each action (specify, plan, implement, review) has an independent first-load timestamp.

### Manual Invocation for Debugging

If you want to see exactly what governance context an action receives:

```bash
spec-kitty charter context --action implement --json
```

This is useful when diagnosing unexpected agent behavior during a workflow step.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Editing Derived Files Directly

`governance.yaml`, `directives.yaml`, `metadata.yaml`, `references.yaml`, runtime state, and
synthesis outputs are owned by CLI commands. Manual changes can be overwritten or can make bundle
validation misleading. Edit `charter.md` instead, then run sync and synthesis as needed.

### Skipping the Interview

Running generate without an interview produces generic defaults. The charter is most valuable when it contains your project's actual policy decisions -- testing thresholds, review requirements, branching rules. Take the time to answer the questions.

### Working with a Stale Charter

If you edit `charter.md` but forget to sync, agents will work with outdated policy from the previous extraction. Run `spec-kitty charter status --json` to check, and `spec-kitty charter sync --json` to fix.

### Enforcing Public-Charter Equality

Do not require `spec/constitution.md` and `.kittify/charter/charter.md` to be markdown-equal
unless your project explicitly chooses that mirror policy. Spec Kitty treats external governance
docs as supporting context and `.kittify/charter/charter.md` as the runtime governance center.

### Keeping Constitution-Era Paths

Do not use `.kittify/memory/constitution.md`, `.kittify/constitution/constitution.md`, or
`.kittify/constitution/{governance,directives,metadata}.yaml` as current runtime paths. Migrate
current policy into `.kittify/charter/charter.md`; move any still-useful public document to a
normal repo path such as `spec/constitution.md` and declare it in `governance_references`.

## Complete Workflow Example

Set up governance for a new project from scratch:

```bash
# 1. Create the Spec Kitty project scaffold
uv run spec-kitty init --ai claude --non-interactive

# 2. Run the interview
uv run spec-kitty charter interview \
  --profile comprehensive

# 3. Generate charter and extracted config
uv run spec-kitty charter generate --from-interview --json

# 4. Verify everything is in sync
uv run spec-kitty charter status --json

# 5. Start working -- governance context loads automatically
uv run spec-kitty specify "Build user authentication module"
```

Later, after updating your charter:

```bash
# Edit the charter
$EDITOR .kittify/charter/charter.md

# Sync changes
spec-kitty charter sync --json

# Verify
spec-kitty charter status --json
```

---

## Charter Synthesis Flow (3.x)

After setting up and syncing your governance (steps 1–4 above), run the Charter synthesis flow
to promote doctrine artifacts for runtime context injection. This is a 3.x addition to the
governance setup workflow.

**`charter synthesize` vs `charter sync` distinction**:
- `charter sync` syncs `charter.md` to YAML config files (`governance.yaml`, `directives.yaml`,
  `metadata.yaml`). Run it after manually editing `charter.md`.
- `charter synthesize` validates and promotes agent-generated doctrine artifacts to
  `.kittify/doctrine/` via the DRG-backed synthesis pipeline. Run it to make doctrine available
  for governed mission context injection.
- They are different operations. You typically run `charter sync` first (after editing), then
  `charter synthesize` to complete the promotion.

```bash
# 1. Check for graph-native decay before synthesis
uv run spec-kitty charter lint

# 2. Synthesize (dry-run first)
uv run spec-kitty charter synthesize --dry-run
uv run spec-kitty charter synthesize

# 3. Validate the bundle
uv run spec-kitty charter bundle validate

# 4. Confirm status
uv run spec-kitty charter status
```

Once synthesis completes successfully, governed mission actions via `spec-kitty next` will
automatically receive the current Charter context.
