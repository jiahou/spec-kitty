# Understanding Spec Kitty Missions

**Divio type**: Tutorial

Spec Kitty supports four mission types that tailor the workflow and artifacts to your goal.

**Time**: ~45 minutes
**Prerequisites**: Completed [Getting Started](getting-started.md)

## What Is a Mission?

A mission selects the default templates, prompts, and outputs for your feature. You choose it during `spec-kitty init` or when running `/spec-kitty.specify`.

## The Three Missions

### Software Dev Kitty

Best for building software features and products.

Example use cases:

- New API endpoint
- UI feature development
- Performance improvements

### Deep Research Kitty

Best for structured research deliverables.

Example use cases:

- Competitive analysis
- Architecture decision research
- Technology evaluation

### Documentation Kitty

Best for creating or updating documentation sets.

Example use cases:

- End-user docs refresh
- API reference overhaul
- Internal playbooks

## Try It: Create a Research Feature

Create a project and select the research mission when specifying a feature:

```bash
spec-kitty init my-research-project --ai claude
cd my-research-project
```

Use `/spec-kitty.specify` with the research mission to start a research workflow.

In your agent:

```text
/spec-kitty.research Compare three task queue options for a Python service.
```

Expected results (abridged):

- `kitty-specs/###-task-queue-research/` directory
- Research artifacts defined by the mission templates

## How Missions Affect Your Workflow

- **Templates**: Each mission uses its own spec/plan/templates.
- **Artifacts**: Research missions create research notes; documentation missions generate Divio-oriented sections.
- **Validation**: Review criteria differ based on mission expectations.

## Troubleshooting

- **"Unknown mission"**: Use `spec-kitty mission list` to list available missions.
- **Missing `/spec-kitty.research`**: Re-run `spec-kitty init --mission research` or refresh agent context with `spec-kitty agent context update-context`.
